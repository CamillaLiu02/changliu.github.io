## Intro

Load and Chaos is a cooperative, Overcooked-inspired laundry simulation game built for a **COMPSCI 506** team project. Players manage a chaotic laundromat—sorting, washing, drying, and folding garments—while obeying care rules and racing the clock to keep customers happy.

## Problem

We needed to design and ship a fully playable co-op game while learning **Unity, C#, and Blender from scratch**, and also keep a four-person team aligned on version control, asset pipelines, and gameplay goals.

## Approach

  alt="Kanban board"
  className="w-full max-w-3xl mx-auto rounded-xl shadow-md"
/>

- **Core loop in Unity (C#):** Implemented interaction detection (ray casts), item pickup/drop, machine states (washer/dryer timers), and scoring with penalties for mistakes or neglect.
- **Level and UI design:** Built laundromat layouts, timers, score HUD, and feedback cues for overloads/missed items; tuned difficulty ramp for co-op pacing.
- **Custom 3D assets:** Modeled washers, dryers, baskets, and props in **Blender** to give the laundromat a distinct feel.
- **Team workflow:** Used **Git + merge requests**, code reviews, and a **Kanban board** to manage tasks; held weekly check-ins to synchronize mechanics and art.
- **Playtesting:** Ran user tests for clarity, difficulty balance, and UI readability; iterated on prompts, timers, and layout based on feedback.

## Results

- Delivered a **fully playable co-op laundry sim** with sorting, washing, drying, folding, scoring, and penalties for violations.
- Established a **repeatable team workflow** (MRs, reviews, Kanban) that kept Unity scenes, scripts, and Blender assets in sync.
- Integrated **custom Blender assets** and polished UI cues so players quickly grasped the chaos and objectives.

## Learnings

/>
- **Unity + C#:** Interaction systems, timers, state handling, and input flows for local co-op.
- **Blender:** Low-poly modeling and export pipelines into Unity prefabs.
- **Collaboration:** Branching, MRs, and conflict resolution for scenes/assets; structured standups and checklists.
- **UX for games:** Signaling state (ready/washing/drying/done), pacing difficulty, and conveying errors under time pressure.

## Next Steps

- Add **online co-op** netcode and better controller support.
- Expand **levels and chaos events** (e.g., machine breakdowns, priority orders, random spills).
- Ship a **tutorial onboarding** with progressive tasks and clearer affordances for new players.
- Improve **accessibility**: colorblind-safe indicators and haptics-friendly feedback.
