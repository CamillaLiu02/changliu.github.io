## Overview

This project involved conducting in-depth UX research on the **UW-Madison Course Enrollment System** to understand user pain points, mental models, and opportunities for improvement. Through a mixed-methods approach combining user interviews, journey mapping, usability testing, and design modeling, we identified critical areas for redesign and proposed solutions for a more intuitive enrollment experience.

### Problem Statement

Students at UW-Madison struggle with course enrollment due to a confusing interface, lack of integrated information, and inefficient workflows. The current system requires navigating between multiple tools (Course Search, DARS, Madgrades) and fails to provide comprehensive course information in one place, leading to frustration and enrollment errors.

## Research Methodology

### Participants & Approach
- **3 UW-Madison students** across different academic levels
- **Qualitative interviews** to understand current processes
- **Usability testing** with live system demonstrations
- **Contextual inquiry** in study environments

### Research Methods Applied
1. **Journey Mapping** - Visualized user experiences and touchpoints
2. **Affinity Diagramming** - Grouped findings into meaningful themes
3. **Cultural Modeling** - Understood institutional context and constraints
4. **Flow Diagramming** - Mapped user workflows and decision points
5. **Physical Modeling** - Documented real-world usage contexts

## Research Methods & Artifacts

### 1. Journey Mapping

![Journey Map](/images/projects/course-enrollment/research/Journey%20Mapping.png)

Journey mapping revealed how students navigate the enrollment process across multiple touchpoints and systems. We documented the emotional highs and lows, pain points, and moments of confusion that occur at each stage of the enrollment journey.

**Key Insights from Journey Mapping:**
- Students experience frustration when switching between tools
- Lack of clear feedback creates anxiety during enrollment
- Information gaps require manual research outside the system
- Advisory support is critical at decision points

---

### 2. Affinity Diagramming

![Affinity Diagram](/images/projects/course-enrollment/research/Affinity%20Diagram.png)

Through affinity diagramming, we synthesized findings from interviews and observations into meaningful themes. This helped us understand the relationships between different pain points and user needs.

**Themes Identified:**
- **Tools for Course Enrollment** - Current tools and their limitations
- **Improvements on Course Search** - Better filtering and information display
- **Course Enrollment System Challenges** - Core interface and workflow issues
- **Advisory Support** - Need for integrated guidance
- **User Observations** - Behavioral patterns and workarounds

---

## Design Thinking Models

### 3. Cultural Model

![Cultural Model](/images/projects/course-enrollment/research/Cultural%20Model.png)

The cultural model maps the institutional and social context of course enrollment at UW-Madison. It shows how university policies, advisor roles, and peer influence shape student behavior and expectations.

**Key Relationships:**
- **UW-Madison** provides regulatory framework and policies
- **Professors** offer guidance and course information
- **Students** need help navigating requirements
- **Course Enrollment System** facilitates the process

---

### 4. Flow Diagramming

![Flow Model](/images/projects/course-enrollment/research/Flow%20Model.png)

The flow model documents the step-by-step process students follow when enrolling in courses, including decision points, system interactions, and potential breakdowns.

**Key Flow Steps:**
1. Figure out how to use the enrollment system
2. Determine course selection based on requirements
3. Check class requirements and availability
4. Check difficulty level and professor info
5. Handle conflicts (full classes, waitlists)
6. Add courses to cart and finalize enrollment

---

### 5. Physical Model

![Physical Model](/images/projects/course-enrollment/research/Physical%20Model.jpg)

The physical model documents real-world usage contexts - where students enroll, what tools they use alongside the system, and environmental factors that influence their experience.

**Observed Contexts:**
- Library study spaces with multiple laptop windows open
- Peer collaboration and advice-seeking
- Physical materials (degree audits, notes) referenced during enrollment
- Time constraints during registration windows

---

### 6. Sequence Model

![Sequence Model](/images/projects/course-enrollment/research/Sequence%20Model.png)

The sequence model provides a detailed interaction timeline showing the exact steps and decision points in the enrollment journey, including necessary transitions between systems.

**Sequence Highlights:**
- Multiple back-and-forth actions between Course Search and DARS
- Need to check Madgrades for professor information
- Scheduler integration for conflict checking
- Final enrollment confirmation step

## Key Findings

### Major Pain Points

**System Challenges**
- Confusing interface with unclear navigation
- Lack of detailed course filtering options
- Missing prerequisite information integration
- Poor professor review functionality
- Enrollment page complexity and lack of confirmation steps

**Workflow Inefficiencies**
- Students must switch between multiple systems (DARS, Course Search, Madgrades)
- No unified view of course requirements and availability
- Difficulty navigating prerequisite checks
- Insufficient back-and-forth action support

**Information Gaps**
- Limited course descriptions and details
- No integrated professor ratings or student feedback
- Missing scheduling conflict notifications
- Incomplete course availability status indicators

### User Insights

#### Advisory Support Needs
- Students need timely guidance during enrollment
- Advisors should be more accessible and integrated
- Clear communication about SOAR registration windows essential
- System should proactively suggest alternatives when classes are full

#### Tool Integration
- Students actively use: UW-Madison Enrollment System, DARS, Google Chrome, Rate My Professor, Madgrades
- Tools lack seamless integration
- Information siloed across different platforms

#### Observations About User Behavior
- Participants use enrollment system every semester
- Heavy reliance on peer recommendations
- Manual tracking of course options and prerequisites
- Participants never choose fewer courses than needed due to system frustrations

## Design Solutions

### Proposed Improvements

#### 1. Integrated Search Interface
- **Unified course search** combining current system, prerequisites, and professor information
- **Advanced filtering** by requirements, difficulty level, past grades, and availability
- **Real-time prerequisite checking** against DARS
- **Integrated professor ratings** and student reviews

#### 2. Enhanced Course Details
- **Comprehensive course information** in single view: description, requirements, schedule, professor info
- **Built-in prerequisite validation** 
- **Course availability indicators** showing section status and conflicts
- **Complementary course suggestions** based on major requirements

#### 3. Streamlined Workflow
- **Step-by-step enrollment process** with confirmation at each stage

## Reflections

This project highlighted how system complexity and fragmentation create poor user experiences even when individual tools work as intended. The key to improvement lies in **integration**, **information design**, and **user-centered workflow optimization** rather than individual feature additions.

The research demonstrated that students are willing to invest effort in complex systems but need better information architecture and integration to make informed decisions efficiently.
